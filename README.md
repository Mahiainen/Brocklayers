# Brocklayers

This is my side quest.
Everything in this repo is churned out with help of AI.
Brocklayers.py is a post prosessing script meant use in slicer. It based heavily on TengerTechnologies (https://github.com/TengerTechnologies/Bricklayers) bricklayers.py script.

Script tries to optimize packing density of layer lines by modulating layer heights and widths. It is possible that this could do some really wonky things and is totally untested so use at your own risk!

Use add lines "your python path" "path to brocklayer.py" -layerHeight 0.2 -extrusionMultiplier 1;
